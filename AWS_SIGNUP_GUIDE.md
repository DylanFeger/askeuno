# AWS Account Sign-Up Guide

## Are You in the Right Place?

**Yes!** You need an AWS account before you can set up S3. This is the first step.

## Do You Already Have an AWS Account?

### Check First:
- Do you have an AWS account for askeuno.com?
- Have you used AWS before?
- Is askeuno.com already connected to AWS Amplify?

**If YES** → Click **"Sign in to an existing AWS account"** instead

**If NO** → Continue with sign-up below

## Recommended Values for Sign-Up

### Root User Email Address
**Recommendation**: Use a professional email you control
