Design Acre’s Home Page

The home page must be purely welcoming and inviting — no actual work or functional tools appear here. Its only purpose is to:

Make new visitors feel welcome.

Clearly and simply explain what Acre does.

Build trust and excitement.

Let logged-in users easily access links to Acre’s workflow if they want to revisit how Acre works.

For visitors not logged in, show a clear, friendly suggestion to sign in or sign up to see how Acre works.

Key Requirements:

1️⃣ Warm, Friendly Hero Section:

Include a short, clear tagline that explains Acre in one line.

Example: “Your business data, simplified — insights in a chat.”

Add a subheading explaining Acre’s core benefit: “Upload or connect your data — Acre handles the rest with secure, smart answers in seconds.”

2️⃣ Inviting Visuals:

Use Acre’s existing brand colors exactly as they are now — keep branding consistent.

Clean, modern design with lots of white space and warm, welcoming elements.

Add an illustration or subtle animation showing the concept of Acre — not the actual tool.

3️⃣ Key Value Points:

Show 3–4 simple benefit highlights:

✅ Connect your data — live or manual

✅ Instant AI answers

✅ Secure, private space

✅ Start free for 30 days

4️⃣ Clear Call to Action:

Add a friendly, clear CTA: “Start Free for 30 Days” or “Try Acre Now.”

Make sign up/sign in the obvious next step for new visitors.

5️⃣ Conditional Workflow Links:

If the user is logged in, display easy-to-find links or a short visual guide to Acre’s main workflow — e.g.:

“How Acre Works” → opens a short page or modal with steps:

Connect/upload your data.

Chat with Acre.

Get clear insights.

If the user is not logged in, do not show workflow links. Instead, suggest they sign up or sign in to unlock Acre’s full experience.

6️⃣ Zero Work on Home Page:

Absolutely no dashboards, chat box, uploads, or live features should appear here.

All real work and tools only appear after the user signs in.

7️⃣ Keep Acre’s Colors:

Use Acre’s current color palette — do not change brand colors.

👉 Goal: Make visitors feel calm, curious, and excited to sign up — with the right info, clear steps, and no complexity on the public home page.
