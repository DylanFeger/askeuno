Before starting anything, analyze the following project scope carefully and respond with a clear and honest assessment of whether you are confident you can fully build this system inside a single Replit environment. Your answer must consider technical limitations such as background tasks, webhook reliability, token security, database connections, scheduled jobs, rate limits, and multi-service architectures. After giving your confidence level, explain any limitations or blockers.

Do not begin implementation until after providing the confidence assessment.

Here is the exact system I need built:

Project Overview
Developing a comprehensive Lightspeed Retail integration that enables secure data connectivity and synchronization for my business platform.

OAuth Integration
Secure authentication flow enabling users to connect their Lightspeed accounts with proper permission management and token handling.

Data Synchronization
Reliable data synchronization system to keep the platform updated with sales, inventory, customer, and product information.

Reliable Architecture
Robust solution with proper error handling, rate limiting, security measures, and monitoring capabilities.

Platform Integration
Seamless integration with the existing platform, enabling users to access and utilize their Lightspeed data effectively.

Detailed Scope of Work

OAuth 2.0 Authentication System
- OAuth 2.0 authorization flow setup
- Token storage and refresh mechanism

- Sales and transaction data handling
- Product and inventory information sync
- Customer data integration
- Multi-location data support
- Data validation and error handling

Webhook and Update System
- Webhook receiver implementation
- Processing of data updates
- Duplicate data prevention
- Retry mechanism for failed processes
- Background processing system
- Logging and monitoring setup

System Architecture and Reliability
