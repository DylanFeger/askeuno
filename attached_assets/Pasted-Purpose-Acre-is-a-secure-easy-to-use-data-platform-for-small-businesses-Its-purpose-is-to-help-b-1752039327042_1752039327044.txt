Purpose:
"Acre is a secure, easy-to-use data platform for small businesses. Its purpose is to help business owners quickly upload or connect their data, store it safely in the cloud, and get clear, real-time answers from an AI assistant — all without needing technical skills. Acre makes business data understandable and actionable, so owners can make better decisions without hiring expensive data teams."

📌 Build Acre with These Core Requirements:
1️⃣ Data Ingestion
Build a secure, user-friendly upload portal (React frontend) where businesses can:

Drag & drop CSV, Excel, or JSON files.

Or connect to popular data sources (e.g., Google Sheets, QuickBooks) using OAuth2 for secure access.

The upload must use HTTPS.

Validate files with Python backend (Flask or FastAPI).

Reject invalid formats & notify users if upload fails.

2️⃣ Secure Storage
Use AWS S3 buckets to store uploaded files.

Use Python’s boto3 SDK to handle storage.

Apply encryption at rest with AWS KMS.

Enable versioning for rollback.

Track file metadata: upload time, owner, file type.

3️⃣ ETL Processing Pipeline
Trigger automatic ETL when a new file is uploaded:

Use AWS Lambda (Python) or backend Python scripts to run:

Extract: Read the file using Python libraries (pandas for CSV/Excel, json for JSON).

Transform: Clean & format the data — handle missing values, unify column names, validate data types.

Load: Insert structured data into your AWS RDS database (PostgreSQL recommended).

4️⃣ Database
Use PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.

Write secure Python SQL scripts using SQLAlchemy or psycopg2:

Create tables dynamically based on uploaded data schema.

Insert rows efficiently.

Handle duplicates or conflicts.

Include example CREATE TABLE, INSERT, and SELECT statements.

Store metadata for each data source: which user owns it, last sync time, version number.

5️⃣ Real-Time AI Query
Build a simple AI chat window in the dashboard (React).

When the user asks a question:

Python backend:

Accepts the question.

Builds a SQL query dynamically based on the user’s intent.

Runs the SQL query securely against the RDS database.

Uses results to craft a short summary.

Calls OpenAI API with the results + question to generate a clear answer in a “text message” style.

The AI should remember prior context (store conversation state per user).

Return the answer to the frontend chat window instantly.

6️⃣ Scheduled Sync & Updates
For connected sources (Google Sheets, QuickBooks):

Use secure OAuth2 tokens.

Build Python cron jobs or AWS Lambda triggers to pull fresh data every night.

Auto-run ETL again.

Add webhook support if the external app supports it (for instant updates).

7️⃣ Scheduled Email Reports
Allow businesses to pick specific metrics/filters to include in custom reports.

Use Python to:

Query the database.

Create a summary report.

Format it as HTML or PDF.

Send it on a set schedule (weekly/monthly) via AWS SES or a secure mail API like SendGrid.

Add logging so failed sends are tracked.

8️⃣ Dashboard
Build a modern, professional React frontend with:

A light, neutral base color palette with light purple accents.

A card-based layout for data sources, sync status, upload history.

Basic charts & stats (integrate Chart.js or Recharts).

The AI chat window.

A clear notification area for sync failures, version rollback, or report scheduling.

Fully responsive for desktop & mobile.

9️⃣ Payments
Integrate Stripe for user signup & subscriptions.

Use Stripe’s Python SDK to:

Handle sign-up, billing, and webhook events for subscription status.

Gate premium features like multiple data sources, bigger storage, AI usage tiers.

10️⃣ Security
HTTPS for all connections.

Store all secrets (AWS, Stripe, OpenAI API) as secure environment variables — no hardcoding.

Add simple user authentication & roles (admin, user).

Log file uploads, data access, and AI query history.

11️⃣ Clean Project Structure
Organize the codebase:

/frontend → React components, Tailwind CSS config.

/backend → Python Flask/FastAPI server, ETL modules, SQL scripts.

/lambda → Example AWS Lambda handler scripts.

/scripts → Python cron jobs for syncs, scheduled emails.

/config → .env.example with required variables.

12️⃣ Deployment
Add a deployment plan:

Use Replit’s deployment or connect to AWS Amplify for frontend hosting.

Deploy backend on AWS Lambda (serverless) or a simple EC2 if needed.

Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL.

Include setup for HTTPS certs.

✅ Deliverables
Starter Python backend with file validation, upload, ETL example, SQL scripts.

Example Lambda handler for auto-processing.

React frontend skeleton with styled components, light purple accent theme.

Stripe payment integration hooks.

Sample cron job for nightly sync.

Sample Python for sending an email report.

README with clear instructions for setting up env variables.

👉 Purpose
"Make Acre feel secure, polished, simple, and effortless — so businesses trust it with their data and use it daily without technical headaches."
