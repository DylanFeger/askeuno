Create Hyppo’s Integrations Page

1️⃣ Purpose:

Design a clear, welcoming page that lists all of Hyppo’s actual supported integrations.

Explain how each connection works: real-time sync, manual upload, or custom API.

2️⃣ Intro Section:

Add a short headline and subheading:

Example: “Hyppo plays well with your tools.”

Subheading: “Connect your business data in real time or manually — Hyppo keeps everything simple and secure.”

3️⃣ Organize by Category:

Group integrations into clear sections:
✅ Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
✅ Cloud Storage: AWS S3
✅ Spreadsheets: Google Sheets, Excel uploads
✅ CRM & Sales: Salesforce
✅ E-commerce: Shopify
✅ Advertising & Marketing: Google Ads
✅ Custom API: For unique or custom-built connections

4️⃣ Logo + Short Description for Each:

Display a recognizable icon/logo for each integration.

Add a short, friendly description for each one:

“MySQL — Structured data for transactions & orders.”

“PostgreSQL — Advanced database for large data sets.”

“MongoDB — Flexible NoSQL document storage.”

“AWS S3 — Store large files and datasets securely.”

“Google Sheets — Quick spreadsheet uploads for easy updates.”

“Salesforce — Sync leads, deals, and contacts.”

“Shopify — Bring in orders, products, and customer info.”

“Google Ads — Pull ad campaign performance data.”

“Custom API — Connect your own systems your way.”

5️⃣ Optional Search or Filter:

If there are many integrations later, add a small search bar or filter by category.

6️⃣ How It Works Section:

Add a short section or link that explains:

“Connect your data live or upload files manually. Hyppo keeps your connections secure and up to date.”

7️⃣ Call to Action:

Add a simple CTA at the end:

“Ready to connect? Get started free today.”

Or “Don’t see your tool? Let’s build a custom integration for you.”

8️⃣ Keep Branding Consistent:

Use Hyppo’s current colors, fonts, logo, and friendly voice.

👉 Goal: Make the Integrations page feel clear, trustworthy, and easy to skim — new visitors should see Hyppo’s real integrations and feel confident they can connect their data quickly.
