Build Acre’s core data pipeline and user flow:

1️⃣ Data Sources

Support multiple data sources: live API connections (Shopify, Google Ads, Salesforce, etc.), direct database connections (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), Google Sheets, and manual uploads of Excel/CSV files.

2️⃣ Manual Uploads

Allow businesses to drag-and-drop Excel/CSV files through Acre’s web UI.

Store uploaded files in an AWS S3 bucket, with unique folders per business account.

When a file is uploaded, automatically extract, validate, and transform the data to add it to that business’s private data store in AWS (PostgreSQL or other).

3️⃣ Live / Real-Time Updates

For supported live sources, design the system to use the best option:

Push: Webhooks where possible (e.g., Shopify order updates).

Pull: Frequent scheduled syncs for sources that don’t support push.

Warn the user if their source doesn’t support live sync. Provide a guided flow for setting up a custom API if needed.

4️⃣ Data Storage & Security

Each business must have a private, isolated data space in AWS.

Data must be securely stored and encrypted at rest and in transit.

Use authentication for API connections (OAuth, API keys).

Allow users to delete old data and upload or connect new sources easily from their Acre dashboard.

5️⃣ AI Chat Layer

Build Acre’s main user interaction as an AI chat that can:

Answer short questions with concise, clear answers.

Run live queries on the user’s latest data.

Generate charts or deeper breakdowns if the user asks for details.

6️⃣ User Experience

Make the setup simple and understandable: clear instructions for connecting live data, uploading files, setting up custom APIs, or managing databases.

Include feedback for users if connections fail or files are invalid.

7️⃣ Pipeline & Tech Stack

Use Python for data processing.

Use AWS S3 for file storage, AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for structured storage.

Implement pipelines to clean, blend, and update new data in real time or near real time.

Ensure robust error handling, logging, and security best practices.

👉 Goal: Acre must feel simple for businesses but deliver robust, real-time insights through a secure AI-powered chat.
